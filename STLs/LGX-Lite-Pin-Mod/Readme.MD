# LGX-Lite Pin Mod

The parts are intended for those who strip down an LGX-Light extruder to get the necessary parts for the toolhead.

So, there are some differences in the BOM compared to the default setup

- The LGX-Lite does not use bearings for the first gear. So, I included part that take only the 3mm pin
- The LGX lite does not use an idler. Therefore, you will miss a 3mm pin. The solution is to simply use a screw for the idler. The mid-section her has a smaller whole to accept the threads for that screw. No inserts required here as there are no forces.
- Last difference is the PTFE tube collet. The Bondtech push-fit collet can be reused on this mod. And I think it's the much better solution than the 3*d collet for this application as it's much easier to remove the tube if required
